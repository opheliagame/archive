# what is an online presence 

for the longest time i have had problems with introducing myself. what do i say to this person within 30 seconds that makes them understand me a wee bit better. what are the important things to say about oneself. which bits should i not mention. 

like should i mention that i have a cat and want to design games for them when i turn 40 something? cos ofc i want to spend my 20s and 30s designing games for humans as a testing ground for my skills. probably shouldnt mention this in an intro right..? 

we are defining ourselves bit by bit everyday and some of these definitions turn out to be more important and stark compared to others. this online presence is made in an attempt to find out my stark definitions.

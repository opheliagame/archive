      i'm gonna try to make these using only glsl cos that's the only way shadows seem to sometimes work for me\\n\
      i'm going to put the shader and inspiration picture side by side so the differences will be quite easily visible.\\n\
      it would be wonderful if you wanted to share a picture of a nook that you're living with perhaps and I'll try to imagine it as a shader! üéâ\\n\

      picture by @kayserifserif ‚ù§Ô∏è apart from everything else she does, she also writes these wonderful alt captions, little poetic descriptions of images, that i'm not going to try to describe cos it won't do any justice, but you should totally go check them now!\
      i took a bit of liberty with this one to try different projections and also cos there are so many minute details and shadows in the picture that i was quite overwhelmed and struck by it at the same time. the contrast between the two buildings is also very fascinating and i'm hoping to also try that some other day üé®",

      the absolutely lovely @computational_mama showed me Raj Rewal recently and while going through some pictures I kept coming back to this small balcony. while all balconies give me a feeling of being able to breathe, this one seemed so cute that I wanted to hug it <3\
      i couldn't find any pictures under creative commons but you can see it for yourself at https://rajrewal.in/portfolio/world-bank-mission-india/ and https://rajrewal.in/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-64.jpg ‚ú®\

      and this truth would take much longer to find if not for #lygia the wonderful library by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo at https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia üå∏üå∏\
      i've been fascinated with these patterns for a while now. the picture is of the outside of a local bank branch. never expected to find something this beautiful over there üòÇ but was happily surprised!\
